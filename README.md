## About the project

This is my take on frameworks. Firstly, I am the only man developing this tool. One that will be compared to other tools built and maintained by teams orders of magnitude larger than a team of one. Someone who stumbles upon this project may not find it apt for their needs, which is perfectly fine. It doesn’t fill my needs either, if it did, I wouldn’t be continuously building and upgrading it.

What is Ana? It is short for Anarchy, a system that questions all hierarchy, authority, and, established rules. Ok, that’s too real-lifey. What does Ana.js question? What is considered to be a hierarchy, authority, or rules in the world of Front-End JavaScript Framework? Well, any answer to this will be completely arbitrary. I wouldn’t even say that the framework goes entirely against the “establishment”, it being the numerous highly competent frameworks that solve problems in the industry. Nevertheless, it does go against certain industry standards.

- **Not a standard, but your standard.**
  
  What does quality mean? What does good code look like? What is a valid use of HTML Elements and their attributes? The industry reduced these questions to a bunch of standards that most people blindly follow. Developers created linters for easy standardization. Ana.js has an integrated linter that checks if the code you’re writing goes according to your own definition of correct.

- **Componentes escritos en js puro**
  - Functional en lugar de declarativo
  - El desarrollador puede desarrollar sus propios componentes.

- **No necesita un compilador o herramiente de buildeo**
  - Se puede importar el CDN desde un .html cualquiera.
  - Pronto se agregará la función de server side rendering.
